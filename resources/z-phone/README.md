# Z-Phone

Welcome to **Z-Phone**, the open-source initiative that transforms the in-game mobile experience in FiveM by introducing a sleek, iPhone-inspired design that prioritizes simplicity and elegance.

## Objective

Our goal is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly phone interface that enhances the gameplay experience without overwhelming players. By focusing on essential features and an intuitive layout, we hope to make communication in the game more enjoyable and immersive.

- **[OX Lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib "OX Lib")**: OX Lib is also required to ensure seamless integration with existing systems.

## Tech Stack

#### (Required) **IMPORT DATABASE**

Go to https://github.com/alfaben12/z-phone/blob/main/z-phone.sql import query to your database to add all table for support z-phone

## IMPORTANT NOTES

Default phone number in QBCore may not be compatible with z-phone. If you use QBCore.Functions.GetPlayerByPhone(number) with a z-phone number, it is likely to return incorrect results. To avoid this issue, it's essential to synchronize the z-phone numbers with the QBCore character information (on table players, column charinfo, key phone).

## BTW

I forgot where I downloaded this iPhone object, as far as I remember I downloaded it from forum.cfx.re, remind me if you know the author.

Please note that in V1.x.x, z-phone has not been optimized. If you want it optimized, that's fine and don't forget to make a pull request.
